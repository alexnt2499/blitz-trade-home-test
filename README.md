# Blitz Trade home test

Tech: ReactJS/NextJS, NodeJS, Web3JS, Typescript.

## Requirement

The following **required** and **option** functionality is completed:

- [x] Write a script in JS/TS to query ERC20 and ETH balance of all the above wallets and
      tokens in ETH mainnet. Calculate the total balance of each token.
- [x] Save data (balance of each wallet and total balance of each token) into a CSV file.
- [x] Optimize the process of querying and saving data as quickly as possible. Don't
      put the optimization on the blockchain through a smart contract library (like Multicall
      SC), do the optimization in your script.
- [x] Please write scripts in TypeScript if possible (you can use "tsx" (TypeScript Execute)
      or "ts-node" to run your TypeScript scripts). We really want to know how you use
      TypeScript.
- [x] Only use "web3js" or "etherjs" library for query balance from blockchain. Any other
      library not related to Blockchain can be used for data processing or query optimization.
- [x] Balance must be displayed in decimal (e.g. 1.2345 ETH).
- [x] Once done, please send back a zip file or Github repository including package.json,
      script, json, and a README file.
- [x] Optional, create friendly UI with TailwindCSS.
